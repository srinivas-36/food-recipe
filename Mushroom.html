          There is nothing better than a good breakfast in the morning to get
          you up and ready to hit your day head on. I do love breakfast, but
          it's always a challenge to fit in something wholesome when you are
          juggling lunch boxes, finding that lost school shoe and trying to get
          yourself out the door as well. As I'm not really a cereal person I
          have to get a bit creative (as well as being organised) for breakfast
          so I can get something quick and tasty to start the day. I think eggs
          are great, very nutritious, so versatile and easy. This stuffed
          omelette is great for any time of the day but it makes a delicious and
          fuel filled breakfast, plus you can bulk it out with some wholemeal
          toast too. Top tip - if you whisk your egg whites and yolk separately
          your omelette will come out super fluffy!
