        <li>
          To prepare the filling (puran), heat a pan and add the grated jaggery
          and coconut, and saut√© until well mixed and thickened. Mix in the
          cardamom powder and turn off the flame. Allow the mixture to cool
          down.
        </li>
        <li>
          To prepare the dough, bring the water to a boil. Add a little ghee and
          salt and mix well. Turn off the flame and add the rice flour, stirring
          to combine well. Cover and let it rest for four to five minutes until
          slightly cooled. Transfer the dough to a clean plate, add one to two
          teaspoons of ghee, and knead to a smooth dough.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into lemon-sized balls and keep them covered.</li>
        <li>
          Divide the prepared filling into equal one tablespoon portions and
          form neat balls, the same number as the rice flour dough balls. Set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make the modaks, take a lemon-sized ball of rice flour dough and
          flatten it. Use your fingers and thumb to make a small cup out of the
          dough. Place one ball of the sweet filling in the centre and bring the
          edges to the top, sealing it. Ensure the top is pointed for the modak
          shape.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling.</li>
        <li>
          Grease the steamer with ghee and place all the prepared modaks on it.
          Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes or until the outer cover becomes
          shiny.
