          South Indian Curd Rice, also known as Thayir Sadam or Yogurt Rice, is
          a traditional dish from South India, particularly popular in Tamil
          Nadu. It's a simple yet comforting dish made with cooked rice and
          yogurt, typically served as a part of a meal or as a standalone dish.
          To prepare South Indian Curd Rice, cooked rice is mixed with fresh
          yogurt (curd), which adds a creamy texture and tangy flavor.
          Sometimes, a little milk is also added to achieve the desired
          consistency. The mixture is then seasoned with a tempering of mustard
          seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, ginger, and sometimes urad dal and
          chana dal for added crunch and flavor. This tempering is usually done
          in oil or ghee. Additional ingredients such as grated carrots, chopped
          cucumber, pomegranate seeds, and coriander leaves may be added for
          extra flavor and texture. Sometimes, a pinch of asafoetida (hing) is
          also added for its aromatic properties. South Indian Curd Rice is
          often served chilled, making it a refreshing dish, especially during
          hot weather. It is considered to have cooling properties and is often
          served at the end of a meal to soothe the palate. It's a popular
          comfort food and is also served during festivals and special occasions
          in South Indian households.
